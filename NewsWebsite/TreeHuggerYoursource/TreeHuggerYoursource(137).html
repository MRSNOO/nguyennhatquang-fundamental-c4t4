Many houseplants are toxic for curious cats and dogs. These ones are all pet-friendly.Houseplants do a house good. Not only do they look lovely, but the degree to which they promote health and wellness for a home's inhabitants is really quite remarkable. From increasing oxygen levels and helping deter illness to cleaning the air and promoting healing, they are silent workhouses giving their keepers a boost. (See more here: 5 health benefits of houseplants.)Unfortunately, however, many houseplants can be toxic to pets – from mild irritation of the mouth to much grimmer (fatal) outcomes. The ASPCA has an epic database of plants that can be searched by pet and/or by the plant's toxic or non-toxic classification. It's a great tool to use when shopping for plants. googletag.cmd.push(function(){googletag.display('div-gpt-ad-1538412165234-0');});Since it can be a challenge to comb through all the toxic plants to find the pet-friendly gems, here are some to start with – favorites from the database that are all listed as non-toxic to cat and dogs.1.
